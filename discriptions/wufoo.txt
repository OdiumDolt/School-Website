    In this project, I helped my parents speed up the productivity of their buissness. This was one of the first projects I ever attempted that wasnet just a project for myself, but was going to be used by someone else.

    I started buy trying to figure out how to make a request to a server in python. I tried a bunch of different ways, but finally setteled on using the requests library. However, my requests to wufoos database kept returning a 401 error. After a little googling, I found that 401 was the error code for a request that did not contain vaild authenticaion. Looking back, this makes sense, as not everybody should be able to access your forum submissions just based off of a url. So I dug into wufoos ducumention for developers.

    I found that Wufoo actually has a super easy to use API that allows you to get data from a http request, as long as you submit a API key in the header of your request. I found my API key for my parents wufoo account, and used the request.auth libarary to add it to my request. after that, I had all the data I needed to make the app the way that I wanted.

    At the time, I just made the interface text based, as thats super easy to do in python. You just enter the name of the person, and it will use the forum data to calcualte their 6 human needs. (Which my parents use to get a better understanding of who a person is, and why they do what they do.) However, I want to use the skills I have leanrnt in this course to make a electron version of the app. Electron is basiclly a portable google chrome, that bundles a website into a native desktop app, which will allow my parents to use the software with a nice ui.
