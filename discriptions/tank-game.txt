    This is my Tank game. (it doesn't have a name. I just call it my Tank game) it supports 2 player online multiplayer, with a super easy to use UI. I learned so much while making this project, and I would like to share how I did it with you here.

    The fist thing I did was find a color pallete. I was really big into upping my typing speed at the time, and was using a website called monkeytype, which had a super clean user interface. You can find it <a class="here-text" href="https://monkeytype.com/">here</a>. I studied their website for ideas on how to make mine look amazing. 
    
    After I found a nice color pallete, I moved on to the actual design of the site.I learned a lot about css. I had never really done much css in the past, however, because I wanted my site to look amazing, I dove into learning as much as I could. I learned about grids, flexboxes, divs, and my personal favorite, borders. I love borders mainly because of the ability to use the border-radius style to give your elements a nice rounded look, which I was quite fond of. (you can see it all over this site)
    
    Finally, I learned about cavases. These things are super powerful. They allow you to control them using javascript, in order to draw basic 2d shapes. After a lot of trial and error, I figured out how to draw some basic shapes, which ended up being the final design of the players. I used my knowledge from physics (sin, cosine, and tan) to make the player rotate, created a map, added online functionality, and then I was done. Im glossing over so much of what I did on the javascript side, but I dont think its super important as this course focuses more on web design.

    I really enjoyed this project, as it allowed me to really test myself in a field that I wasn't super confident in. I learned lot about web development, javascript, and game development in this project. You can find the project <a class="here-text" href="https://github.com/OdiumDolt/Tanks">here</a>.
